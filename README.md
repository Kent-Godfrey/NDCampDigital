# Northern Dabblers - Tower Defence Tweeting Game
The team: Ben Whalley, David Warringon, Kent Godfrey and Ollie Crook!

## What is this?
This is a collaborative University project that tasked us to visualise data about a specific conference, Camp Digital.

## How does it work?
The main bulk of the game is canvas, javascript and jQuery. A small python file using the Twython module and the TwythonStreamer is used to access the Twitter Streaming API and a few lines of Ajax allowed us to read the change in data, triggering the fireball.

## Who are the Northern Dabblers
